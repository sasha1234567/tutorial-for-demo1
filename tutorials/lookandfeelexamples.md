### Time to Compete

Beginners will take 30 minutes to finish this tutorial.

## Host Configuration

Access your HANA instance that was created in ["How to create an SAP HANA Developer Edition in the Cloud"](http://go-qa.sap.com/developer/tutorials/setup-hana-for-cloud.html).

Chose Notepad as the Open with Editor.

## HANA Studio Configuration

### ![](http://go.sap.com/dam/application/shared/icons/icon_gold_circle_01.svg) Adding the HANA Studio Perspectives

Open the HANA Studio via the Windows Start menu or via the Icon on your Start bar.

If your HANA Studio opens to the following Overview screen, simply press Workbench to return to the full Studio tooling.

To support the new developer centric workflow, there are two additional Eclipse Perspectives which have been added to SAP HANA Studio. These are not displayed by default.

In the upper right corner of your SAP HANA Studio, there is an add Perspectives button.  Press this.

>Note must be displayed as a "blockquote" with blue backgrounnd, example, [](http://hcp.sap.com/developers/TutorialCatalog/jav100_01_java_setup_eclipse.html).

Add the SAP HANA Development perspective. This is the perspective you should be using for almost this entire workshop.

### ![](http://go.sap.com/dam/application/shared/icons/icon_gold_circle_02.svg) Create a connection to the HANA server
Make sure you are in the SAP HANA Development perspective by clicking on the button.

Input the server hostname: hanapm

Input the instance number: 00

Enter a meaningful description of your choice.  Press the Next button.

## Optional - Use SSH to log in to the Linux OS
Connecting to the underlying Linux OS in the cloud instances is different for each provider.  Follow the instructions for the cloud provider you have chosen to host HANA.

### Amazon AWS
To connect to Amazon AWS, you must use the key-pair that was provided by Amazon when the instance was created.

#### Connecting to AWS from Windows

1. Using the key-pair file (\*.pem) downloaded from Amazon, create a private key file for putty using puttygen.exe.  
2. Open PuTTY on your computer, and enter the IP Address for your instance in the Host Name (or IP address) field. Click the ```Open``` button.
3. When the connection is opened, enter ‘root’ as the user. You can now change the default password for the hdbadm OS user with the command ```passwd hdbadm```. Your new password must be entered twice, and it will be checked to ensure it is sufficiently secure. Once you have entered an appropriate password twice, then you are finished!

For more detailed instructions, check out the [Amazon AWS guide to Connect Your Amazon EC2 Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/computebasics-linux/getting-started-deploy-app-connect.html).

#### Connecting to AWS from Mac or Unix

From Linux or Mac OS-X, in terminal window, run this command: ```ssh -i [hanakey].pem [IP Address] -l root```  (Replace [hanakey].pem with the name of your key-pair file, and [IP Address] with the IP address of your instance.)

For more detailed instructions, check out the [Amazon AWS guide to Connect Your Amazon EC2 Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/computebasics-linux/getting-started-deploy-app-connect.html).

## A few notes
* Some corporate firewalls may not allow SSH to Amazon cloud.  You may have to work with your IT organization to resolve this.
* User hdbadm owns sap software in the Linux instance. To restart the database without restarting the entire Linux instance, switch to user hdbadm and perform stop and start operations using the following commands:
    * ```su – hdbadm``` To switch user.
    * ```./HDB stop``` Command to stop HANA DB
    * ```./HDB start``` Command to start HANA DB
* The default password of user hdbadm is HANAabcd1234. You should change this password using the Linux command ```passwd hdbadm``` after creating your instance. Enter your new password (described above) when HANA Studio prompts you for the ```<SID>adm``` logon to perform administrative tasks.
